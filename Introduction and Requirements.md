## 1. SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT BACKGROUND
Let me explain by sharing the 'Big Picture' with you ... I really do need guidance and advice on how to earn a meaningful income.

Firstly some history to put you in the picture:

Before the internet became the default go to, I had a small software development house consisting of myself as the hands-on business owner, and a bunch of professional IT developers who all had other full time employment positions but outsourced their talents to me, trading as "Accessible Database Design", on an after-hours basis. Our company profile stated that our emphasis was in the following areas:

    1. Client/server application development using MS Access and Visual Basic. Our staff has a wide range of experience on popular back-end RDBMS's such as Oracle, SQLBase, Sybase and MS SQLServer.
    2. Enterprise level application development using Centura and Oracle CDE Tools (Forms 4/4.5, Report Writer 2.0, CASE 6.0).
    3. Data and Process Modeling: Capable re-engineering of existing databases produces specifications and design documentation which is then used to fortify system knowledge and maintenance.

There is an archived version of our then company web site at http://add.zimpics.com for your reference should you be interested.

As i have said, that was all before the advent of the internet. In fact, if i remember correctly, email had not yet surfaced. I remember we were still dealing with faxes. So around 1995 i would say. The company operated successfully for approx. 10 years, before folding on the arrival of the internet.

So even though it has been almost 30 years since I did any serious coding I am still totally familiar with the concept of RDB design and management with CASE tools, and it seems to me that nothing much has changed with respect to MySQl (now MariaDB) and the sequel language.

However, back at that time the front end was done using Centura and SQLBase, and everything had to be  implemented and maintained locally. There was no such thing as 'Hosting'.

So that is the background.

## 2. NEED TO EARN:
I need you to analyze my current situation and advise on ideas in which i can use my experience and collaborating with AI to produce sustainable income. I have been using AI coding assistance now for almost 12 months on various projects from a local document management system, to GAS spreadsheet apps to React Web App. All projects have been fully controlled via GitHub. I have used GitHub to publish a web site and used Vercel and Railway to develop and publish a distributed accounting system. Most importantly however, I really need to earn meaningful income as the family an i need to purchase a home to live in before my demise.

So I would like you, after considering my position and history, to come up with viable and practical pathways to earn a steady meaningful income stream .... I will be open to all ideas!!


## 3. FAMILY:
I am about to turn 77 years old and have again become invigorated with coding due to the advent of AI. Previously I had seen learning all the new development languages as an insurmountable challenge, but since discovering CursorAI I now believe that I can see a way forward, as I have a pressing problem to solve.

The problem resolves around finances.

After all that I have accomplished in life i find myself dependent upon Government assistance for day-to-day living. I need to change this before i become incapacitated by old age, as i have a young family consisting of a wife being 30 years younger and two dependent children in their late teens. Shall i continue?

Well, as you have deduced, my motivation to 'start again' is to establish a suitable level of income stream that can in a relative short time earn enough to purchase a basic home ... the median price in Perth, Western Australia is currently $AUD600,000. I think i might have found agency to accomplish this through the advent of AI, and specifically CursorAI.

At present my spouse has a permanent nursing assistant position that earns $AUD75,000 per year (to put that into perspective the median wage in Australia is currently at $AUD80,000) which is just enough to sustain a meager standard of living as we currently a living in a property over which i have a life-estate (it is owned by my daughter) and so we pay no rent nor have any debts.

Please give this serious consideration. As i said i am open to ALL suggestions so it is over to you to employ your inspirational and deep knowledge base to come up with workable ideas. Lets discuss them ... now over to you.
